# MythicalWorldsGame
A stardew valley inspired game style with focus on browns and catchy gameloop. Rustic, folk and magical woodland experience, where you play as a small forest spirit.


# Takeways
- **CSS:** I believe going into this project after having the knowledge from the Web UI course I have a much better understanding of how css works and its structure. As someone who enjoys keeping things organised and clear, I find that to not be an issue when it comes to css and I can visually see exactly what changes when I modify my code. I would like to produce more work with CSS in the future.


# Main struggles
- **Sprites:** Adding images, specifically sprites is something I keep struggling. For this project I had prepared some sprites to use but could not figure out how to fully make them work. In the initial java stages I opted for coloured blocks to test functionality.
- **Java:** I have found out of html, css and java, java is the one I struggle with the most. The general idea I get however, wheenever I try to implement numbers or have to take into account measurements, it can get very tricky. It is also the one I find less 'fun' to work with.
