# Forest Spirit Runner — Concept

## Theme & Premise
**Theme fit:** Mythical Forest 
You play as a small, ethereal forest spirit exploring a magical woodland. Dodge natural hazards, collect glowing wisps, and survive as long as possible. The visual style is soft and painterly, inspired by Stardew Valley, with pastel tones, subtle lighting, and a calm, enchanting atmosphere.

## Core Loop
1) Tap/click to jump; arrows/thumb buttons to move left/right.  
2) Avoid natural obstacles; collect wisps (+score).  
3) Collide with danger => lose life; 0 lives => Game Over.  
4) Submit initials and replay to beat your **high score**.

The loop is short, replayable, and encourages mastery and exploration of the forest.

## Goals & Success
- **Primary goal:** Highest survival time/score.  
- **Secondary goal:** Collect all 50 wisps in a single run.  

## Controls
- **Keyboard:** Arrow keys / A D (move), Space (jump), P (pause)  
- **Touch:** Left / Right / Jump buttons (≥44×44 CSS px)
