# Forest Spirit Runner Concept

## Theme and Description
**Theme:** Mythical Forest 
The overal theme of the game is a rustic, folk and magical woodland experience, where you play as a small forest spirit. This forest spirit looks no different than a regular villager. You must dodge hazards, collect glowing wisps, and survive as long as possible. I have opted for a visual astyle with a softer approach, mostly inspired by the Stardew Valley visuals, with pastel tones that trascend a calm and enchanting appearance. This forest hides many secrets which you must avoid to survive.

## Core Loop
1) Tap/click to jump; arrows/thumb buttons to move left/right.  
2) Avoid natural obstacles; collect wisps (+score).  
3) Collide with danger => lose life; 0 lives => Game Over.  
4) Submit initials and replay to beat your **high score**.

The loop is short, replayable, and encourages mastery of the forest.

## Goals & Success
- **Primary goal:** Highest survival time/score.  
- **Secondary goal:** Collect all 50 wisps in a single run.  

## Controls
- **Keyboard:** Arrow keys / A D (move), Space (jump), P (pause)  
- **Touch:** Left / Right / Jump buttons (Upwards arrow does not indicate you can walk upwards, hence why there's a pause option instead of a downwards arrow.)

## Sketches
The sketches attached in this same folder provide initial simpler ideas. I have tried to bring this design to live and better it. For this game's visuals, I believe the fonts and colour palette go a long way since it's loop focused. I have replaced the lives idea with a score that goes up based off time spent playing.

## Why a simple loop?
- **Efficiency:** For this project, since I am not any expert in java I wanted to focus on a catchy looping game. There are different difficulty options (with wich only speed changes) but all of them have some degree of difficulty implemented. 
- **Testing:** While testing the game myself and with other family members, they actually found this loop got them hooked instantly.
- **Visuals:** I believe this approach allows me to put in the same amount of effort not only in the html but also the css part of the game. I researched fonts and palettes that would best represent its theme.
